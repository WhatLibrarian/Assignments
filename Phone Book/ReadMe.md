Darrell - 

 I left the name variable as a string to account for non-western naming cultures. This will account for people with mulitple last names or who reverse the usual first name first paradigm.  It does make it harder to sort... 

 I don't have ENUMS because name, addy, city and phNum are open-ended data that users can fill with any value.  ENUMS work best with things like days of the week or months of the year where the values are known and limited.

 Bonus Points:
- Case-switch, 
- Try/Catch
- private vars
- program in 3 files
- tiny tiny main
- modify an entry
- delete an entry
- Print list in table format
