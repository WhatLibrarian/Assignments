## From Canvas


For this assignment, you will be creating a wordsearch puzzle using 2-dimensional and 1 dimensional arrays, a string, and chars.  

You will begin with instructions.  Then give your user an opportunity to play, and make a selection (Sounds like a do-while loop).  

1) Create a wordsearch puzzle

2) View a wordsearch puzzle with solutions 

3) View a wordsearch puzzle without solutions 

4) Quit  

I recommend a 2 dimensional array for the solution and a 2 dimensional array for the actual puzzle.  You can then use either a string or 1 dimensional array for each row. 

I  recommend an array size of about 20 characters.  I recommend limiting the lengths of the words to no more than 8 characters and no more than 8 words.
